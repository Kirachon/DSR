- **Health Monitoring:** All services expose health endpoints
- **Security Integration:** Spring Security configured across all services

### Configuration Management ✅
- **Profile-based Configuration:** No-database mode properly configured
- **JPA Exclusions:** Database auto-configurations properly disabled
- **Application Properties:** Service-specific configurations working
- **Mock Service Layers:** Registration Service has complete mock implementations

### Testing Results ✅
- **Health Check Tests:** All services responding with "UP" status
- **API Functionality Tests:** Registration Service APIs returning mock data
- **Service Startup Tests:** All services start without errors
- **Integration Tests:** Services can communicate when needed

## Deployment Configuration

### Current Deployment Mode
- **Environment:** Local Development
- **Database:** No-database mode (mock services)
- **Security:** Spring Security enabled
- **Monitoring:** Actuator endpoints active

### Service Ports
```
Registration Service:      localhost:8080
