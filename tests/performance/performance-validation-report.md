- **Recovery Testing:** Monitors system recovery after stress conditions
- **Relaxed Thresholds:** 95% requests < 5 seconds, error rate < 20%

**Stress Test Stages:**
1. Normal load (500 users)
2. High load (1000 users)
3. Stress load (1500 users)
4. Extreme stress (2000 users)
5. Breaking point (2500 users)
6. Recovery validation (1000 users)

### 3. Production Data Generator ✅ IMPLEMENTED

- **Household Structures:** Realistic family sizes and relationships
- **Volume Scaling:** Supports production-level data volumes (4.4M households)

**Data Types Generated:**
- Household registrations with complete member information
- Eligibility assessments with PMT calculations
- Payment transactions with FSP integration data
- Grievances with realistic complaint patterns
- Emergency/disaster response scenarios

### 4. Production Load Scenarios ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**File:** `tests/performance/scenarios/production-load-scenarios.js`

**User Patterns Based on Stakeholder Analysis:**
- **DSWD Staff (15%):** Heavy system users, 2-8 hour sessions
- **LGU Staff (25%):** Moderate users, 1-4 hour sessions
- **Case Workers (30%):** Field-based users, 30 minutes - 3 hours
- **Citizens (20%):** Self-service portal, 5-30 minutes
- **System Admins (10%):** Power users, 1-6 hour sessions

**Load Scenarios:**
- Business Hours: 500 users, 8-hour duration
- Peak Registration: 1500 users, 4-hour duration
- Payment Disbursement: 2000 users, 6-hour duration
- Month-End Reporting: 800 users, 3-hour duration
- Emergency Response: 3000 users, 12-hour duration

### 5. Disaster Response Scenarios ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**File:** `tests/performance/scenarios/disaster-response-scenario.js`

**Emergency Load Patterns:**
- **Immediate Response:** 5000 users, 24-hour duration (10x normal load)
- **Extended Response:** 3000 users, 14-day duration (5x normal load)
- **Recovery Phase:** 1500 users, 90-day duration (2x normal load)

**Disaster-Specific Operations:**
- Mass household registration (batch processing)
- Emergency eligibility assessments
- Mobile field registration with GPS coordinates
- Urgent grievance processing
- Real-time disaster analytics

### 6. Performance Test Execution Script ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**File:** `tests/performance/run-performance-tests.sh`

**Automation Features:**
- **Prerequisites Check:** Validates K6 installation and service availability
- **Multi-Platform Support:** Linux, macOS, Windows compatibility
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** HTML, JSON, CSV output formats
- **Service Health Validation:** Checks all 7 DSR services before testing
- **Combined Reports:** Generates unified performance assessment
